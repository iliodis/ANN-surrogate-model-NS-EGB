# ANN-surrogate-model-NS-EGB
Contains the results of the work "A neural-network-based surrogate model for the properties of neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03991), conducted during my bachelor thesis at the Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, under the supervision of professor Nikolaos Stergioulas. The interested readers are referred to the paper for a more complete understanding of these models' pros and cons, as well as their limitations.

In the notebook "Usage demonstration" I demonstrate how to load and use the resulting ANN models of this work.

The environment.yml file contains all the required python pachages to load and use the models.
